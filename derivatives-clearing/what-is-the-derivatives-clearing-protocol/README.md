# What is the Derivatives Clearing Protocol

Reya Derivatives Clearing is a **non-custodial clearing protocol for derivatives instruments.** The Derivatives Clearing Protocol is the cornerstone that allows Reya to act as a self-reinforcing liquidity network. One of its distinguishing features is that it can aggregate positions from multiple markets _and_ multiple exchanges into a single margin account. In particular, this provides both traders and LPs with unprecedented capital efficiency by offsetting:

1. **Losses from one position with profits another**, and enabling leveraging of all portfolio profits immediately
2. **Margin requirements,** by recognizing the P\&L offset that can happen between positions
3. **P\&L and margin **_**across**_** exchanges,** by aggregating all positions into a single settlement and clearing layer

Connecting exchanges can be both DeFi or CeFi venues supporting the trading of any linear derivative contract (e.g., Futures, Swaps) via any on- or off-chain trading mechanism (e.g. Orderbook, AMM, Passive LP pool). By deploying its own appchain, Reya aims at providing these benefits while bringing on-chain the experience and speed of traditional centralized exchanges.

The basic concept in the Derivatives Clearing Protocol is that of a _collateral pool._ This is a compartment within the smart contract where margin deposits for any given market are kept and managed. Each of the userâ€™s margin accounts is associated with one such collateral pool. Cashflow obligations are settled peer-to-pool. To make sure these are properly settled, the protocol has three main components:

1. Margin system that manages margin requirements for different settlement tokens and ensures safe levels of collateralization
2. Cross-collateralization module that manages features around collateralization with tokens other than the settlement token, as well as the auto-exchange mechanism which forces conversion to manage risk levels
3. Liquidation module that manages liquidation procedures when an account is declared liquidateable by the margin system.
