# Who's behind Reya Network

Reya Labs, the creator of Reya Network, is run by a team of DeFi OGs with multiple successful start-ups launched in the past, including Voltz Protocol, which grew to over $30B of notional traded within just 12 months.

We are backed by some of the best names in the industry and have raised almost $10M from VCs, including Framework, Coinbase and Wintermute.

Alongside this, weâ€™re supported by an incredible community! Many of our community members have been with us through our previous projects, and now help drive product development and accelerate the adoption of Reya Network.
