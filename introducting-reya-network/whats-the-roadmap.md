# What's the roadmap

Reya Network is a revolution coming in stages.

As a liquidity network, the logical first step is to kickstart the network with the inflow of liquidity. That is why first up on our roadmap is a Liquidity Generation Event (LGE) scheduled for April. More details on the LGE will follow soon, so watch this space.

Straight after the LGE, weâ€™ll prove the concept of the Reya Network by deploying a fully functional perpetual DEX, Reya Exchange. Reya Exchange will be the first exchange on the network, and will also act as a vehicle to attract even more liquidity and traders, creating powerful network effects for the exchanges that follow.

Reya Network will then open up to other exchanges, ultimately becoming the substrate on which a new generation of DeFi can live.
