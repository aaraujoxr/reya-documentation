# Imagining a new governance

Because the network will be an interlocked system of components, a single governance layer will be introduced for the entire network. In particular, all components will share the same governance token - $REYA. Details will follow when appropriate, but this page explains the guiding principles.

Reya Labs embraces a full decentralized ethos while also recognizing the importance of responsible governance. It will deploy the next generation of governance layer, blending the best features of token-governance (incentives-driven decentralized governance) with the best features of the regulated world (stakeholders with skin in the game).

In particular, governance staking will bundle a series of benefits and liabilities:

1. stakers will qualify for governance voting for the entire network;
2. stakers will participate in Treasury management and revenue sharing;
3. stakers will act as the last backstop to the entire Network, by having their staked tokens underwrite a capital fund, a decentralized analogue of a CCP’s “own capital funds” in regulatory system that will increase overall trust in the system.

The inclusion of the capital fund as a final layer in a system of backstops is a fundamental tool in aligning the interests of shareholders: a say in governance paired with revenue potential as well as potential liability as the final backstop, ”skin in the game”.
