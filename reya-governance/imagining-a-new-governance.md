# Imagining a new governance

Because the network will be an interlocked system of components, a single governance layer will be introduced for the entire network. In particular, all components will share the same governance token - $REYA. Details will follow when appropriate, but this page explains the guiding principles.

Reya Network will decentralise governance to future $REYA stakers ensuring the network isn’t controlled by any single entity and providing transparency and trust through to the end users of the system. Trust and transparency also improves the composability of the network giving other exchanges confidence they can operate on the network, too. In turn this will help accelerate adoption of Reya Network and further deepen liquidity for end users.

In particular, governance staking will bundle a series of benefits and liabilities:

1. stakers will qualify for governance voting for the entire network;
2. stakers will participate in Treasury management and revenue sharing;
3. stakers will act as the last backstop to the entire Network, by having their staked tokens underwrite a capital fund, a decentralized analogue of a CCP’s “own capital funds” in regulatory system that will increase overall trust in the system.

The inclusion of the capital fund as a final layer in a system of backstops is a fundamental tool in aligning the interests of shareholders: a say in governance paired with revenue potential as well as potential liability as the final backstop, ”skin in the game”.
