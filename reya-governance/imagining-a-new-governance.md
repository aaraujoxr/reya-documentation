# Imagining a new governance

Reya Network will decentralise governance to future $REYA stakers ensuring the network isnâ€™t controlled by any single entity and providing transparency and trust through to the end users of the system. Because the network will be an interlocked system of components, a single governance layer will be introduced for the entire network. In particular, all components will share the same governance token - $REYA.&#x20;

Trust and transparency also improves the composability of the network giving other exchanges confidence they can operate on the network, too. In turn this will help accelerate adoption of Reya Network and further deepen liquidity for end users.

Details will follow when appropriate.
