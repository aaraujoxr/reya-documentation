# The three pillars of Reya Network

Reya Network is the world's first trading-optimised L2 and reimagines DeFi foundations, with unique unlocks that will revolutionize how we see its future. There is a way of seeing the DeFi revolution not as a story about applications, but a story about infrastructure. And that infrastructure at present creates various obstacle to development, with vertically integrated applications fragmenting liquidity in siloes and inefficiently deploying capital, and generalizable rollups limiting performance and user experience.

Reya Network tackles this problem head on by conceiving DeFi foundations both modularly and holistically. Modularly by splitting it into a series of trading specialized components; but holistically by designing them in tandem so that they remain composable and integrated. The originality in this last aspect can hardly be overstated: Reya Network cuts across traditional divisions between financial primitives, but especially between the financial and the technological layers. It **is** a true reimagining of DeFi foundations.

Concretely, by focusing on a single use case - trading - Reya Network moves beyond technical improvements only and also integrates financial logic to improve capital efficiency and liquidity, which is embedded into the Network itself and accessible by any exchange operating on the Network.

Reya Network liberates the application layer of DeFi by creating an autonomous, specialized and optimized infrastructure that solves for the following 3 core pillars:

## Liquidity

The liquidity optimisations mean capital staked in Reya Network is used productively to support trading via a novel passive liquidity pool mechanism, providing instant and shared liquidity to every exchange built within the Reya ecosystem. This improves market depth, accelerates exchange’s go-to-market and enhances the trading experience for users on a given exchange. Furthermore, all liquidity is organized as a network between exchanges, rather than siloed, creating ‘interoperable liquidity’ between exchanges for the first time.

## Capital Efficiency

Reya Network embeds margin engine logic into the network itself. This means users have a single margin account that can be used across multiple exchanges - in many respects creating a decentralized clearinghouse for the first time. The logic of the margin engine is the most advanced in crypto, providing up to 3.5x improvements in capital efficiency for traders, and up to 6x improvements in capital efficiency for LPs. Any exchange on Reya Network inherits this logic automatically as a result of operating on the network.

## Performance

Reya Network has blocktimes of 100ms and throughput of up to 30,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest EVM rollups. It is also a gas-free network, meaning transactions are executed on a ‘first-in-first-out’ (FIFO) basis, in line with major trading venues. This removes front-running and harmful MEV. This functionality is built leveraging the Arbitrum Orbit tech stack. Over time, additional optimisations will be built, including the continued movement of application-specific logic into the network design itself.

Ultimately, Reya Network is the next iteration of network design and will become the substrate for a new generation of DeFi applications.
