# The three pillars of Reya Network

Reya Network is the world's first trading-optimised L2 and reimagines DeFi foundations, with unique unlocks that will revolutionize how we see its future. There is a way of seeing the DeFi revolution not as a story about applications, but a story about infrastructure. And that infrastructure at present creates various obstacle to development, with vertically integrated applications fragmenting liquidity in siloes and inefficiently deploying capital, and generalizable rollups limiting performance and user experience.

Reya Network tackles this problem head on by conceiving DeFi foundations both modularly and holistically. Modularly by splitting it into a series of trading specialized components; but holistically by designing them in tandem so that they remain composable and integrated. The originality in this last aspect can hardly be overstated: Reya Network cuts across traditional divisions between financial primitives, but especially between the financial and the technological layers. It **is** a true reimagining of DeFi foundations.

Concretely, by focusing on a single use case - trading - Reya Network moves beyond technical improvements only and also integrates financial logic to improve capital efficiency and liquidity, which is embedded into the Network itself and accessible by any exchange operating on the Network.

Reya Network liberates the application layer of DeFi by creating an autonomous, specialized and optimized infrastructure that solves for the following 3 core pillars:

_1. Liquidity_

The liquidity optimisations mean capital staked in Reya Network is used productively to support trading via a novel passive liquidity pool mechanism, providing instant and shared liquidity to every exchange built within the Reya ecosystem. This improves market depth, accelerates exchange’s go-to-market and enhances the trading experience for users on a given exchange. Furthermore, all liquidity is organized as a network between exchanges, rather than siloed, creating ‘interoperable liquidity’ between exchanges for the first time.

_2. Capital Efficiency_

Reya Network embeds margin engine logic into the network itself. This means users have a single margin account that can be used across multiple exchanges - in many respects creating a decentralized clearinghouse for the first time. The logic of the margin engine is the most advanced in crypto, providing up to 3.5x improvements in capital efficiency for traders, and up to 6x improvements in capital efficiency for LPs. Any exchange on Reya Network inherits this logic automatically as a result of operating on the network.

_3. Performance_

Reya Network has blocktimes of 100ms and throughput of up to 30,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest EVM rollups. It is also a gas-free network, meaning transactions are executed on a ‘first-in-first-out’ (FIFO) basis, in line with major trading venues. This removes front-running and harmful MEV. This functionality is built leveraging the Arbitrum Orbit tech stack. Over time, additional optimisations will be built, including the continued movement of application-specific logic into the network design itself.

Ultimately, Reya Network is the next iteration of network design and will become the substrate for a new generation of DeFi applications.

### **Why Create Reya Network?**

As a team of DeFi OGs, we have witnessed first hand the limitations of generalisable L2s. Whilst these L2s have helped scale Ethereum, their generalisable design limits their ability to scale DeFi.

The most obvious limitation is the mass liquidity fragmentation that has emerged, where each new exchange built on a generalisable rollup has to compete for a limited supply of liquidity. The impact is substantial, resulting in shallower markets across all exchanges, which hurts traders and market participants. Alongside this, the generalisable design creates limitations that exchanges have to inherit, such as front-running and harmful-MEV, and performance limitations due to the inability to parallise execution.

Reya Network is a paradigm shift in how we think about scaling. We believe networks don’t need to be generalisable, but instead can be optimised for a single use case. For Reya Network, we focus on trading by optimising for the three pillars of Liquidity, Capital Efficiency and Performance.

### **Who’s behind Reya Network**

We’re founded by a team of DeFi OGs with multiple successful startups to our names, including Voltz Protocol, which grew to over $30B of notional traded within just 12 months.

We’ve raised almost $10M from some of the best investors in the world, including Framework, Coinbase and Wintermute.

### **The immediate roadmap and Reya Exchange**

Reya Network is a revolution coming in stages. The first step will be the launch of the Network, which will by initiated by deploying a fully functional perpetual exchange on the network, Reya Exchange.

Reya Exchange is not only the first exchange on the network, but also a vehicle to jumpstart Reya Network, attracting liquidity and traders to unlock its powerful network effects.

Together with further building and development of components, Reya Network will then open up to other exchange, ultimately become the substrate on which a new generation of the DeFi ecosystem can live.
