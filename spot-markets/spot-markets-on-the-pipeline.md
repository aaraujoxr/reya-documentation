# Spot markets on the pipeline

Although not included at the initial deployment, Reya will include spot markets in addition to derivatives trading. This will unlock synergies with the rest of the Network, in particular related to rUSD distribution by creating markets against other stablecoins, as well as auto-exchange and CDP liquidations, which imply conversion of different types of collateral.

When spot markets within Reya Network attract enough liquidity, they will also enable the Network to internalize the spot benchmarking needs both in the clearing and the liquidity layers.
