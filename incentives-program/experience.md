# Experience

The incentives program has 2 aspects:

* Users can earn Experience Points, or XP, for various activities on-chain.
* XPs also allow users to unlock Ranks coming with special NFTs that register your contributions to the Network on-chain. The higher the rank, the more perks you unlock.

Details on ranks will be announced later.

### Accruing Experience

XPs will be accumulated in user’s wallet continuously from LPing and trading activities, giving a summary of all activity in the network.

Experience points accrue relative to an account’s balance: LP accounts accrue .1% **per minute** of the capital invested into the passive pool.

With time, XPs will be gradually adjusted according to the build up of the Network’s activity. LP accounts accrue XP by making capital available for trading during a period of time, not just by depositing and withdrawing capital. Similarly, when trading incentives are introduced, Reya Network will prioritise traders who hold positions over a period of time over those opening and closing their positions. In this way we disincentivize wash trading.&#x20;

As an example, if an LP deposits $1,000 for one month in the pool, they accrue

$$
1,000\times .001\times 60\times 24\times 30 = 43,200\mathrm{xp}
$$



This, of course, does not take boosts into account. Early users can unlock boosts that multiply the rate at which these XP accrue.

If after the first month they withdrew half of their capital (including returns), in the following month they would accrue XP only over the capital that is left. In other words, XPs are only accumulated on the deposited capital.
