# Bootstrapping the Network

Reya is a Liquidity Network and our incentives program is one of the first steps to ensure the depth of liquidity.

We are inviting users to be among the first LPs on Reya Network. In return we are offering an incentives program that prioritises early adopters and gives a boost for experience points you earn and leads to higher rewards. All these different activities are rebased into an XP balance that will then be used to distribute rewards. Since multiple partners are used within the Reya Network design, additional reward programs may be announced as the Network develops.

The fundamental aim of the incentives program is to unlock the network effects in Reyaâ€™s design by seeding a sustainable initial level of liquidity. We aim to create a flywheel effect: deep liquidity generates optimal trading conditions and attracts traders, while large trading volumes in turn lock in liquidity and ensure superior returns on capital.
