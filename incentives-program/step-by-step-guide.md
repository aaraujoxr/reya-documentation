When you access the LGE page, you will see a page informing you of the current boost, i.e., the boost you can get on the funds you deposit now. Click on “Reserve Boost”.

This will take you to the deposit page. Connect your wallet by clicking the button at the bottom.

If it is your first time connecting, you will be prompted to accept the Terms and Conditions. When you click, “I accept”, your wallet should prompt you to sign them.

At the top of the deposit page, you will see the boost currently awarded on deposits that are done now, that is the boost you can lock on the amount you deposit now. You can also see how far along that boost is from being reduced. Finally, if you have deposited funds before, you can check your current balance in the pool, as well as the boost you have locked in on those past deposits, as well as your accrued xp.

Use the dropdown to select the network you want to bridge funds from. Then, “Switch Chain”.

Once you switch chains, you can write the amount you want to deposit. For convenience, your wallet balance is shown immediately below (”Available”). You can also see the estimated gas that the source chain will charge you (Reya Network itself is gas free). Press “Deposit”.

Once you sign the transaction on your wallet, a pop up will the submission. The transaction itself might take 5-10 minutes to go through, depending on the source chain.
