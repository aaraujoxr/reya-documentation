    More on this will be revealed once trading starts. But XP will be important!

    The LGE period will last for two weeks only.
*   **When will you launch the Reya Perps DEX?**

    Trading on Reya Exchange will open soon after the LGE closes.
*   **Which chains do we support?**

    Reya supports bridging from Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum Orbit, Optimism Mainnet and Polygon PoS.
*   **How does XP accrue?**

    XP is gained by depositing into the Passive LP pool (either during this LGE or after) and trading on Reya exchange. You can gain a boost to your accrual rate during this LGE period by depositing early, or by being lucky in the random boost game. More details on XP will be shared once trading starts. For depositing, $1,000 \* 1x boost â‡’ 1 XP per minute; more boost increases this rate of accrual.
*   **When can I unstake? Is there a cooldown period?**

    Funds on Reya Network are non-custodial and available to withdraw at any time. A withdrawal button on the dApp is coming soon to improve the UX, but in the interim you can withdraw directly from the Reya Network smart contracts should you wish to do so.
*   **Which wallets do you support?**

    We currently support Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect, Rabby Wallet, Ledger and Trezor.
*   **Can I deposit via my mobile**

    Yes! Whilst a desktop will provide the optimal experience, you can also deposit from a mobile phone. The Metamask and Coinbase wallet in-app browsers provide the best experience. Many other wallets are supported with wallet connect with more support coming soon.
* **I have made a deposit, but it still doesn't show up.**\
  Deposits take a while to bridge from other chains. expected time is 5-10 minutes, but given the amount of deposits the network is getting, the delay time may fluctuate. We are working to Socket (our bridging partner) to make sure they get processed as quickly as possible.
* **My deposit already shows in the source chain's block explorer, but I still don't see it in the UI.**\
  Bridging takes two transactions, from the source chain to Socket, then Socket to Reya Network. Your deposit will show up as soon as it is processed on Reya Network. If you want, you can double check on our Block Explorer (see the resources page in the docs).
*   **How does the boost work? How long does the boost last?**

    The boost you lock in during the LGE period will last into trading on Reya Exchange. The 48h random boost will stop boosting your XP accrual after 48h. You can always return to play the game again and gain an additional 48h boost! Boosting will increase the rate at which you gain XP in Reya. To gain any XP you will need to deposit liquidity or trade.
*   **Will ranking continue after the LGE?**

    Ranks will have a big part to play in the Reya Exchange leaderboard. More details will be shared once trading starts.
*   **How many friends can I refer with my referral link? Is there a cap?**

    No cap - spread the word. You will gain 10% of the XP accrued by those you refer. Keep track of how many referrals you have, and the XP gained from them, on the leaderboard page.
